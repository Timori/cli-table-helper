Version 1.2.0

Version 1.1.1-r1
---------------
Readme has been rewritten. General corrections

~ Readme -> The Readme has been rewritten. A new example is there, representing the latest state.
+ Small fixes

---------------
Version 1.1.1
---------------
makeTable no longer adds Seperators. If Seperators are needed, they can be added using tableObject.addSeperator().

~ makeTable() -> Doesn't take parameters no more.
~ addSeperators(string, integer|20) -> addSeperator has been fixed. The method now adds the wanted seperator as intended.

---------------
Version 1.1.0
---------------
The table is now built as a pure string. You can get that string after using makeTable(boolean, boolean) with tableObject.table. That way, direct usage of console.log can be avoided.

~ displayTable() -> is now a void method. It simply uses the console.log function to print the table. Also, this method no longer creates the table. Use makeTable to create the table.
~ Readme has been updated.
+ makeTable(boolean, boolean) -> New method to create the table. The table is now built as a pure string. Parameters are the same as for the old displayTable(boolean, boolean) method.
